Puzzle 1 | (How to Measure 45 minutes using two identical wires?)

-> How do we measure forty-five minutes using two identical wires, each of which takes an hour to burn? 
-> We have matchsticks with us. The wires burn non-uniformly. 
-> So, for example, the two halves of wire might burn in 10 minutes and 50 minutes respectively

 
Answer:
-> If we light a stick, it takes 60 minutes to burn completely. 
-> What if we light the stick from both sides? It will take exactly half the original time, i.e. 30 minutes to burn completely.

    0 minutes – Light stick 1 on both sides and stick 2 on one side.
    30 minutes – Stick 1 will be burnt out. Light the other end of stick 2.
    45 minutes – Stick 2 will be burnt out. Thus 45 minutes is completely measured.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
Puzzle 2 | (Find ages of daughters)
    
-> Alok has three daughters. His friend Shyam wants to know the ages of his daughters. Alok gives him first hint. 

1) The product of their ages is 72. 
Shyam says this is not enough information Alok gives him a second hint. 

2) The sum of their ages is equal to my house number. 
Shyam goes out and looks at the house number and tells “I still do not have enough information to determine the ages”. 

Alok admits that Shyam can not guess and gives him the third hint 

3) The oldest girl likes strawberry ice cream. 
Shyam is able to guess after the third hint. Can you guess what are the ages of the three daughters? 


Answer: 
1) Product of ages is 72 

Below are all possibilities to get 72 from product of three different ages: 
1 * 1 * 72 = 72 
1 * 2 * 36 = 72 
1 * 3 * 24 = 72 
1 * 4 * 18 = 72 
1 * 6 * 12 = 72 
1 * 8 * 9 = 72 
2 * 2 * 18 = 72 
2 * 3 * 12 = 72 
2 * 4 * 9 = 72 
2 * 6 * 6 = 72 
3 * 3 * 8 = 72 
3 * 4 * 6 = 72 

2) Sum of the ages is given 
1 + 1 + 72 = 74 
1 + 2 + 36 = 39 
1 + 3 + 24 = 28 
1 + 4 + 18 = 23 
1 + 6 + 12 = 19 
1 + 8 + 9 = 18 
2 + 2 + 18 = 22 
2 + 3 + 12 = 17 
2 + 4 + 9 = 15 
2 + 6 + 6 = 14 
3 + 3 + 8 = 14 
3 + 4 + 6 = 13 

All sums are unique except 14. So the age sum must have been 14, otherwise, Shyam would have guessed the ages from hint 2 only. 
So we have two possible combinations to get a sum of 14 

2 + 6 + 6 = 14 
3 + 3 + 8 = 14 

3) Alok has the oldest girl (not two!!). So the ages must be 3, 3 and 8. 









Puzzle 3 | (Calculate total distance travelled by bee)

-> Two trains are on same track and they are coming toward each other. 
-> The speed of the first train is 50 km/h and the speed of the second train is 70 km/h. 
-> A bee starts flying between the trains when the distance between two trains is 100 km. 
-> The bee first flies from first train to second train. 
-> Once it reaches the second train, it immediately flies back to the first train … and so on until trains collide. 
-> Calculate the total distance travelled by the bee. Speed of bee is 80 km/h. 

  
  

Answer: 66.67 km approx. 

Solution: 

    Let the first train A move at u km/h.
    Let the second train B move at v km/h.
    Let the distance between two trains be d km

    Let the speed of bee be b km/h

    Therefore, the time taken by trains to collide = d/(u+v)

Now putting all the known values into the above equation, we get, 
 

u = 50 km/hr
v = 70 km/hr
d = 100 km
b = 80 km/hr

Therefore, the total distance travelled by bee 
= b*d/(u+v) 
= 80 * 100/(50+70) 
= 66.67 km (approx)



Another Solution:

Another easier approach to solve this can be by using the concept of relative velocity:

With respect to Train A, train B’s velocity is (70+50) = 120 km/hr. Thus, the time taken by Train B to collide with Train A will be

 (100 km) / (120 km/hr)  = 5/6 hr = 50 min

 Now, since the velocity of the bee is 80 km/hr, the distance travelled by the bee in this time interval will be

 80 km/hr * 5/6 hr = 66.67 km (approx)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Puzzle 4 | (Pay an employee using a gold rod of 7 units ?)
 
 An employee works for an employer for 7 days. The employer has a gold rod of 7 units. How does the employer pay to the employee, so that the number of employee’s rod units increases by one at the end of each day? The employer can make at most 2 cuts in the rod. 

(Hint- after the end of the day employee’s can’t spend any part of rod)

Solution: 
The employer can pay for seven days by making 2 cuts in a way that he has 3 rods of size 1, 2 and 4. 
1st Day: Employer gives 1 unit cut. 
2nd day: Takes back 1 unit cut from employee given on the first day and gives 2 unit cut. 
3rd Day: Gives 1 unit and then the employer is left with 4 unit rod lengths. 
4th Day: Takes back cuts of 1 and 2 units. Gives the cut of 4 units. 
5th Day: Gives cut of 1 unit to the employee. 
6th Day: Takes back cut of 1 unit and gives a cut of 2 units. 
7th Day: Gives cut of 1 unit to the employee. 









Puzzle 7 | (3 Bulbs and 3 Switches)

There is a room with a door (closed) and three light bulbs. Outside the room, there are three switches, connected to the bulbs. You may manipulate the switches as you wish, but once you open the door you can’t change them. Identify each switch with its bulb. All bulbs are in working condition.
Solution:
Let the bulbs be X, Y, and Z 
Turn on switch X for 5 to 10 minutes. Turn it off and turn on switch Y. Open the door and touch the light bulb. 
1. the light is on from the bulb, it is Y 

Now we will check other two off bulbs 
2. the bulb which is hot, it is X 
3. the bulb which is cold, it is Z  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Puzzle 8 | (Find the Jar with contaminated pills)
 
 -> You have 5 jars of pills. Each pill weighs 10 grams, except for contaminated pills contained in one jar, where each pill weighs 9 grams. 
 -> Given a scale, how could you tell which jar had the contaminated pills in just one measurement?
 
 Solution: To find the contaminated Jar, follow this step-wise approach.

    Step 1: Take out 1 pill from jar 1, 2 pills from jar 2, 3 pills from jar 3, 4 pills from jar 4 and 5 pills from jar 5.
    Step 2: Put all these 15 pills on the scale. The correct weight is 150 (15*10). But one of the jars has contaminated pills. So the weight will definitely be less than 150.
    Step 3: If the weight is 149 then jar 1 has contaminated pills because there is only one contaminated pill. If the weight is 148 then jar 2, if the weight is 147 then jar 3, if 146 then jar 4, if 145 then jar 5.
    
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Puzzle 9 | (Find the fastest 3 horses)
 
 There are 25 horses among which you need to find out the fastest 3 horses. You can conduct race among at most 5 to find out their relative speed. At no point you can find out the actual speed of the horse in a race. Find out the minimum no. of races which are required to get the top 3 horses. 

The solution is 7. 

First, we group the horses into groups of 5 and race each group in the race course. This gives us 5 races (see image below). 

 

horspuzzle1

In the image, each row represents one race of 5 horses. For convenience, let us name the horses using row and column index. Therefore, the first race(row 1) was contested between the horses R1C1, R1C2, R1C3, R1C4 and R1C5. The second race (row 2) was contested between the horses R2C1, R2C2 and so on. Let us assume that the fifth member of each row won the race (R1C5 won the first race, R2C5 won the second race and so on), the fourth member of each row came second (R1C4 came second in the first race, R2C4 came second in the second race and so on) and the third member of each group came third (R1C3 came third in the first race, R2C3 came third in the second race and so on). 

 

horsepuzzle2

Next, we race the 5 level 1 winners (R1C5, R2C5, R3C5, R4C5 and R5C5). Let’s say R1C5 wins this race, R2C5 comes second and R3C5 comes third. 

 

horspicture3

The winner of this race (R1C5) is the fastest horse of the entire group. Now, the horse which is second in the entire group can either be R2C5 or R1C4. The horse which is third in the entire group can either be R3C5, R2C4 or R1C3. Therefore, we race these 5 horses. 

 

horspicture4

Therefore, the horse R1C5 is the fastest horse. The horses which come first and second in the last race are the horses which are second and third in the entire group respectively. in this way, the minimum number of races required to determine the first, second and third horses in the entire group is 7. 
This explanation is provided by Feroz Baig 
 
Alternate Explanation: 

Make group of 5 horses and run 5 races. Suppose five groups are a,b,c,d,e and next alphabet is its individual rank in this group(of 5 horses).for eg. d3 means horse in group d and has rank 3rd in his group. [ 5 RACES DONE ] 
a1 b1 c1 d1 e1 
a2 b2 c2 d2 e2 
a3 b3 c3 d3 e3 
a4 b4 c4 d4 e4 
a5 b5 c5 d5 e5 

Now make a race of (a1,b1,c1,d1,e1).[RACE 6 DONE] suppose result is a1>b1>c1>d1>e1 
which implies a1 must be FIRST. 
b1 and c1 MAY BE(but not must be) 2nd and 3rd. 
FOR II position, horse will be either b1 or a2 
(we have to find top 3 horse therefore we choose horses b1,b2,a2,a3,c1 do racing among them [RACE 7 DONE]. 
The only possibilities are : 
c1 may be third 
b1 may be second or third 
b2 may be third 
a2 may be second or third 
a3 may be third 
The final result will give ANSWER. suppose result is a2>a3>b1>c1>b2 
then answer is a1,a2,a3,b1,c1. 
HENCE ANSWER is 7 RACES 
Please note that the 7 races work for the case also when all top 3 horses are same group or any top two horses are in same group. The group which has top 3 horses would always have winner in 6th race. In 7th race, we consider 2nd and 3rd horses of the group whose horse is overall winner. We also consider 2nd horse of the group whose horse came 2nd in 6th race. 









Puzzle 10 | (A Man with Medical Condition and 2 Pills)

Puzzle: A man has a medical condition that requires him to take two kinds of pills, call them A and B. The man must take exactly one A pill and exactly one B pill each day, or he will die. The pills are taken by first dissolving them in water. 

The man has a jar of A pills and a jar of B pills. One day, as he is about to take his pills, he takes out one A pill from the A jar and puts it in a glass of water. Then he accidentally takes out two B pills from the B jar and puts them in the water. Now, he is in the situation of having a glass of water with three dissolved pills, one A pill and two B pills. Unfortunately, the pills are very expensive, so the thought of throwing out the water with the 3 pills and starting over is out of the question. How should the man proceed in order to get the right quantity of A and B while not wasting any pills? 
    
    
Solution: Follow this step-wise approach to help the man take his medicine in a correct way.  

    Step 1: Add one more A pill to the glass and let it dissolve.
    Step 2: Take half of the water today and half tomorrow.

It works under the following assumptions.  

    The dissolved Pills can be used the next day.
    The man has to take pills at least for one more day.

Alternate Solution:

    The person can boil the solution in jar B and water gets evaporated. Thus, the residue of medicine will be left.
    Now he can take half of the residue, which will be equivalent to a single pill and take the rest tomorrow.

It works under the following assumptions:

    Some of the medicine does not evaporate with water.
